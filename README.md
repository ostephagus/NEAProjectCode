# NEA Fluid Dynamics Simulation Code
This is a repository for the code I make as part of my technical solution of my A-Level Computer Science NEA.

## CPU Backend
The CPU Backend is the first part of the project, allowing me to get to grips with C++, and is mostly the same as the code in the Griebels Book. **INDEV**

## GPU Backend
The GPU Backend is the evolution of the CPU Backend to work on a GPU, using parallelisation and SIMD (Single-Instruction Multiple-Data) for greater processing efficiency. **TODO**

## UI
The UI is written in C# using the WPF library and provides a GUI for the project. **INDEV**

## Visualisation
The visualisation is written in C# using OpenGL to display a colour gradient of a field. It takes the data directly from the backend to display in a portion of the UI. **TODO**
